> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator


## Getting Started

This generator creates Xcode projects for iOS apps in the style that I've come accustomed to using. Rather than the 
default format that Apple gives you, this has a more conventional style. There are standard groups for typical
class types like Controller, Model, View, Service, Layout, etc., and they're mapped to actual folders. They'll help you
maintain a folder structure that looks more like your project. This is especially helpful when viewing the code with other
tools.

After you have installed Yeoman, install the generator and scaffold out an app:

```bash
npm install -g generator-ios
yo ios
```
